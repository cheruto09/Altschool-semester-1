Objectives

– Practice using lists and dictionaries in Python.

– Learn how to define and use functions.

– Take input from users.

– Perform simple calculations like averages.

– Organize your code for readability.

Tasks / Features

Open `student_data.py` and complete the following tasks:

1. Fill in the `add_student()` function to collect student info from the user.

2. Complete the `view_students()` function to display all students.

3. Implement `get_average_grade()` to return the average grade of all students.

Month 2 [DEG 502]

Introduction

You’ve just joined a small retail company, MiniMart, as a junior data analyst. They need help building a simple data system to manage sales and customer data using SQL for storage and querying, and Python for analysis and reporting.

Project Objectives
Design and create SQL tables to store sales data.
Insert sample records and retrieve useful insights using SELECT, WHERE, and JOINs.
Use SQL aggregation functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG() to compute key metrics.
Write Python code to simulate data collection and basic reporting.
Apply Python data structures and logical operators to manipulate and analyze data.
SQL Tasks
Create the tables listed above using CREATE.
Alter one of the tables to add a new column (ALTER TABLE).
Insert at least 5 rows into each table.
Retrieve all orders made by a specific customer (WHERE + JOIN).
Get the total number of orders (COUNT()).
Calculate the total revenue from all orders (SUM(price * quantity)).
Use INNER JOIN to show order details including customer and product names.
Use LEFT JOIN to show all products and any related order (even if not sold).
Python Tasks
Create lists or dictionaries to simulate new order data.
Use if, and, or to identify customers who placed large orders.
Convert product prices from string to float and apply discounts (type conversion).
Create a dictionary report summarizing:
Total number of products sold
Most popular product
Revenue per customer
